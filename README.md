# ILBPM9987L

This project contains solutions to different progcont exercises as per the requests of the instructor.


## Safety hazards

**May cause damage to eyes through prolonged or repeated exposure**

The main goal of these exercises is the algo part, so be warned: **no cleancode**

We were encouraged to try out different things, like fiddling around with StringBuilder::delete to circumvent reinstantiations,
or for specific constrained inputs we could use simple arrays instead of hashmaps,
or using exceptions to quickly jump back to a specific point etc.,
or to figure out whether some fancy language feature is slower than its C-style counterpart,
or doing some nasty things to ensure constant additional space need (like modifying arrays in-place).
